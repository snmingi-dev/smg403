## Product-Specific Checklist

### Auto Cataloger

1. Preview signature gate blocks stale Apply.
2. Default Apply skips non-asset datablocks (no auto-mark by default).
3. Optional `Auto-Mark Missing as Assets` works when enabled.
4. `.cats` backup is created on write.
5. `Restore from .bak` restores previous file content.

### Post-Unwrap Cleaner

1. Selection is restored after execution.
2. Pinned UVs stay untouched when `Respect Pins` is ON.
3. Straighten=0 case still allows Relax/Pack.
4. Multi-object edit mode fails safely with clear message.

### Smart Curve Helper

1. Operators are only available in `EDIT_CURVE`.
2. Axis Space (Local/World/View) behaves as expected.
3. Flatten Reference options produce reproducible planes.
4. Handle type application is consistent after each operator.
