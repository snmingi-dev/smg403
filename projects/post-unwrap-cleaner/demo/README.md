# Post-Unwrap Cleaner Demo Assets

Expected demo files:

- `post_unwrap_cleaner_demo.blend`
- `one-click-flow.gif`
- `before-after.gif`

## Build Notes

This environment does not currently have Blender CLI (`blender`) installed, so a valid `.blend` file cannot be generated automatically here.

Manual creation steps:

1. Open Blender 4.2+ and UV unwrap a mesh with mixed pin/selection states.
2. Save as `post_unwrap_cleaner_demo.blend` in this folder.
3. Record one-click cleanup flow and before/after result GIFs.
