# Auto Cataloger Demo Assets

Expected demo files:

- `auto_cataloger_demo.blend`
- `preview-apply.gif`
- `before-after.gif`

## Build Notes

This environment does not currently have Blender CLI (`blender`) installed, so a valid `.blend` file cannot be generated automatically here.

Manual creation steps:

1. Open Blender 4.2+.
2. Create sample assets with mixed naming and unassigned catalogs.
3. Save as `auto_cataloger_demo.blend` in this folder.
4. Record `Preview -> Apply -> Asset Browser result` GIF.
