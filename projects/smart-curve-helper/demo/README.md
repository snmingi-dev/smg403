# Smart Curve Helper Demo Assets

Expected demo files:

- `smart_curve_helper_demo.blend`
- `curve-ops-flow.gif`
- `before-after.gif`

## Build Notes

This environment does not currently have Blender CLI (`blender`) installed, so a valid `.blend` file cannot be generated automatically here.

Manual creation steps:

1. Open Blender 4.2+ and create Bezier curve examples.
2. Save as `smart_curve_helper_demo.blend` in this folder.
3. Record Align/Flatten/Equalize operator flow and result GIFs.
